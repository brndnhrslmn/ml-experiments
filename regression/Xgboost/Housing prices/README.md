<h2>Linear Regression using the XGBoost algorithm</h2>

<p>A pipeline implementation of the XGBoost algorithm for predicting housing prices.</p>

<p>The pipeline was contstructed using the following elements, with a view of making the modelling process as efficient as possible as well as allowing for adjustments to be made easily</p>

<p><h3>Pipeline elements</h3><ul>
<li>Feature extraction</li>
<li>Data transformation</li>
<li>Value imputation</li>
<li>Model training</li>
<li>Model evaluation</li>
</ul></p>
